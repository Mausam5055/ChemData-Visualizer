00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,453
Hi I am Mausam Kar. This is my

2
00:00:03,453 --> 00:00:04,870
hybrid chemical equipment visualizer.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,704
Let's jump straight in. I am logging into

4
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:10,183
the web app first. First I will

5
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:12,662
demonstrate the CSV upload by I am

6
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:14,787
selecting the required sample CSV. The

7
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:17,267
Jango back end parses this using pandas

8
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,392
and instantly returns the analytics. Here

9
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:21,684
are the. Visualizations using Chart JS.

10
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:24,333
As we can see, the visualizations are

11
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,225
the distribution by equipment type,

12
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:28,118
correlation between pressure and flow

13
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:30,388
rate, and temperature trends over time.

14
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:33,038
Here are the visualization. As we can

15
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:35,687
see, we also have a history management

16
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:38,336
saving the last five uploads for quick

17
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:41,180
access for each user. And also we

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,848
have a global log for all the user

19
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:46,183
uploads. We also have a dedicated feature

20
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:48,517
and guides page and a context section.

21
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:50,518
For now switching to the desktop

22
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,853
application built with Pyqt 5, I am

23
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,854
logging in with same credentials. Notice

24
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,522
how the data I just uploaded on the

25
00:00:57,522 --> 00:00:59,523
web is immediately available here. This

26
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,680
proves the share back end. Integration

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,620
Instead of web charts, we are using

28
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,140
native matplotlib figures here for high

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,820
performance offline analysis. For

30
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,760
reporting I will just generate a PDF

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,700
report which is created server side with

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,220
report lab containing all the critical

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,740
statistics and equipment lists. Also we

34
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,676
can see the user information for. Each

35
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:24,956
user logged in into the website within

36
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:27,236
the dashboard for both web and the

37
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:29,190
desktop app. Here how it looks.

38
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,468
The entire stack is containerized using

39
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,550
Docker. My Docker compose setup

40
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,049
orchestrates this Django API, React front

41
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:40,963
end and database volumes as we can

42
00:01:40,963 --> 00:01:43,878
see in our Docker desktop the images

43
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:46,793
that we have created for the front

44
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:49,707
end and back end services and also

45
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:51,892
the containers. On which both the

46
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:54,082
services are being running. Also we can

47
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:56,586
see the detailed log of the back end

48
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:59,089
requests sent to the front end. For back

49
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:01,592
end hosting we have used render. So this

50
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:03,783
is our render platform where we have

51
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:06,286
hosted the back end. For front end we

52
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:08,477
have used versal for deployment. This is

53
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:10,667
my versal dashboard where I have hosted

54
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,520
it. So as we can see, for

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,427
24/7 availability of the back end we have

56
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,607
used something called Uptime Robot. So

57
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:20,787
this is the Django administration panel

58
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:23,693
through which I can manage all the users

59
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,510
who are using my application.

60
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,177
The entire project is available in GitHub

61
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:33,973
and the documentation for the same is

62
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:36,370
being provided along with the preview

63
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,368
images for the application. The

64
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,366
architecture diagrams for both dockerized

65
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:42,763
and non dockerized development are being

66
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,160
provided in the README as well.
