**Total Time:** ~2:30 - 3:00 minutes  
**Goal:** A clean, narrative script for your demo recording. Speak naturally as you perform the actions on screen.

## ⏱️ 0:00 - 0:50 | Web Application (The Core Workflow)

"Hi, I'm [Your Name]. This is my **Hybrid Chemical Equipment Visualizer**. Let's jump straight in.

I'm logging into the **React + Vite Frontend**.
First, I'll demonstrate the **CSV Upload**. I'm selecting the required `sample_equipment_data.csv`.

The **Django Backend** parses this using **Pandas** and instantly returns the analytics.

Here are the visualizations using **Chart.js**:

- **Distribution** by Equipment Type.
- **Correlation** between Pressure and Flowrate.
- And **Temperature Trends** over time.

We also have **History Management**, saving the last 5 uploads for quick access."

## ⏱️ 0:50 - 1:20 | Desktop Application (Cross-Platform Sync)

"Now, switching to the **Desktop Application** built with **PyQt5**.

I'm logging in with the same credentials.
Notice how the data I just uploaded on the web is **immediately available here**.
This proves the shared backend integration.

Instead of web charts, we're using native **Matplotlib** figures here for high-performance offline analysis."

## ⏱️ 1:20 - 1:50 | Reporting & Admin Panel

"For reporting, I'll generate a **PDF Report**.
This is created server-side with **ReportLab**, containing all critical statistics and equipment lists.

On the backend control side, here is the **Django Admin Panel**.

I can inspect the raw **Equipment Records** and manage **Registered Users** directly, ensuring full control over the system's data integrity."

## ⏱️ 1:50 - 2:30 | Deployment & Architecture

"The entire stack is **Containerized** using Docker.
My `docker-compose` setup orchestrates the Django API, React Frontend, and Database volumes.

For production:

- The Web App is live on **Vercel**.
- The API is hosted on **Render**.
- And **Uptime Robot** confirms our 100% availability.

Finally, the **GitHub Repository** contains the full source code and this detailed **Architecture Diagram** explaining the hybrid data flow.

Thank you!"
